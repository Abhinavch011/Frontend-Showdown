            largest amphitheater in the world.<br>

            2. The arena had 36 trap doors for special effects, as well as many underground passages and rooms to hold
            wild animals and gladiators before the games began.<br>

            3. The Colosseum had a velarium, a type of awning used in Roman times. This pulled over the top of the
            seating area to shade the spectators and protect them from the scorching sun.<br>

            4. Some of the games in the Colosseum lasted up to 100 days. However, gladiator contests stopped in 435 AD
            and the last animal hunts were in 532 CE. This was partly due to the cost of acquiring animals and
            gladiators, alongside maintaining the arena.<br>

            5. Itâ€™s estimated that over 400,000 people and over a million wild animals died during the centuries that
            the games took place.</p>
